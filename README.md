This repo is being utilized for keeping track of all programming assignments
for CS 420 Advanced Programming Languages.

Assignment 1: 

Using C programming language this program will take in a grayscale image
convert the PGM file using threshold as well as rotating the file. 


1. Your C program should read any given grayscale images in pgm format. Grayscale images have pixel values ranging from 0-255. This pixel values can be treated as unsigned characters.
2. The image data should be loaded as a 2D matrix.
3. The 2D matrix should be manipulated to threshold the given image and convert it to a
binary image.
4. The 2D matrix should be manipulated to rotate the given image left.
5. The manipulated 2D matrices should be converted back to grayscale image. This image
should be viewable.
